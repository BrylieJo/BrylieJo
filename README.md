- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  --The project that I will be talking about today is the Clock Project fro Module 3. We created a clock that would tell the time and display it correctly.
  The only problem it would solve would be that now people have access to a clock.
- What did you do particularly well?
--  I believe that I organized the code well.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
--  There is still much to learn in the arena of coding in general for me. There are always more ways to make your code more efficient and secure which in time I will know how to do efficiently.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
--  I got stumped multiple times throughout the code but I would refer back to my textbook for further help when this happened. 
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
 -- The skills that I gained from this project was paitence and determination.
